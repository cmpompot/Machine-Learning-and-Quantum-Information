# qm_projects Bompotas Christos
A repository of all the projects in the Computational Quantum Mechanics class from Msc of Computational Physics in AUTH university .
This repository contains two python codes for computating the information entropy for each element up to Neon. One is the coefficients dictionary and runs the code (run_quantum) and the other contains all the necessary functions (quantum_functions). The corresponding report is named "(report_quantum_bompotas.pdf)". There is also a jupyter notebook containing a machine learning classification project (ML_Bompotas.ipynb) along with its report (ML_BOMPOTAS_REPORT.pdf).
